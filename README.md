These are the project files used on my personal project for the Coursera course "Machine Learning for All"

https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-machine-learning-for-all/

Project Name: "Identifying Tintin characters using Machine Learning"
The objective of this project is to use a Machine Learning model to classify pictures of characters as one of these four Tintin's characters:
- Tintin
- Captain Haddock
- Milou (Snowy)
- Professor Tournesol (Cuthbert Calculus)

The contents for the two folders in this repository are:

Dataset -> Files used to train our model
Dataset - Tintin
Dataset - Haddock
Dataset - Milu
Dataset - Tornassol

Tests -> Files used to test the model
The files chosen have been chosen using different criteria
- Pictures from the actual characters as coming from the Tintin stories
- Pictures of merchandising objects from Tintin's books
- Pictures from actors from Tintin's Steven Spielberg movie or pictures of humans disguised as Tintin's characters
- Pictures of characters that could be similar to Tintin's characters:
	- Test17.jpg -> August Picard, which was suppossed to inspire HergÃ© to create the Professor Tournessol
	- Test36.jpg and Test40.jpg -> Ronald Koeman, Dutch football player and coach
	- Test32.jpg and Test33.jpg -> Boris Johnson, which depending on the background color is classified as Haddock or as Tintin
